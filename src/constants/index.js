export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I am Luke Manyamazi, an IT professional with a wealth of experience in remote and onsite technical support. Over the years, I've cultivated a deep passion for technology and programming, continuously expanding my skill set. I have completed several key courses, including the CS50P Python Course, which strengthened my understanding of problem-solving with Python, as well as FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification, which helped me master the basics of building accessible, user-friendly websites. I also completed CloudComputing 101 on Coursera, broadening my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and services. These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in both software development and web technologies.
Currently, I am a trainee at CodeYourFuture, where I am sharpening my coding skills through hands-on projects and collaborative learning. I am also in my second year of the BSc Honours in Computer Engineering at Zimbabwe Open University, further expanding my technical knowledge. I am passionate about exploring new programming languages and technologies, and I look forward to applying my skills to build real-world solutions. Through my GitHub, I aim to share my learning journey and projects with the developer community, while continually improving and taking on new challenges.
My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack software engineer, capable of developing robust, end-to-end applications that solve meaningful problems. I am committed to continuous learning and growth as I work towards this objective.
